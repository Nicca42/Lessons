# Project 2: Automated Tick tack toe

In this lesson we will take the game of tick tack toe we made in the last lesson and make player 2 a bot! This means that we (as player 1) will be able to play against our code.

## Pre-requisites
Before being able to complete this lesson you will need to know how to do the following:
1. Importing a library 
2. Execute functions from a library

## Project iterations
Below is a list with the various iterations of the project. 
These version are intended to break the project down into accomplishable steps, where at the end of every version you will have new functionality implemented. 

### Version 1.0.1
Make a function that will randomly generate a number between 1 - 9

**This function should:**
* [ ] Return a random number between 1 - 9

### Version 1.0.2
In this version, we will make a function called `auto_player_two()` that will generate a random number, check that space is a valid space to move to, and then move. 

**This function should:**
* [ ] Call the random number generator
* [ ] Use the random number to make a move 
* [ ] If the number provided by the random number generator is a taken move, the call should loop until a number is generated that is a valid move

### Version 2.0.0
No we are going to edit our `play_game()` function to ask the user if they want to play against another person, or a bot.

**This function should:**
* [ ] Ask the user if they want to play against a user or a bot
* [ ] Depending on the users input, the game should either call `auto_player_two()` or `player_two()`

**When the script is run:**
* [ ] Ask the user who they want to play against and act accordingly.
